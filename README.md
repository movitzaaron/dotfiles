Welcome to my dotfiles.

These have been created with the help of other dotfiles [TODO: link to who I looked at], and ChatGPT.

To install these on a machine (must be running Linux - WSL is fine - or MacOS) follow this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./fresh.sh
```
